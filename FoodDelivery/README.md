## What is the need for ViewModel?
                            
- We use MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern in this Project.
- The ViewModel separates the UI (View) from the data (Model).
- Using a ViewModel ensures your app is maintainable, testable, and scalable, especially as the complexity of your app grows.
